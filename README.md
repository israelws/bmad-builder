**Build More, Build better.** Create custom BMad agents, workflows, and domain-specific modules with guided assistance.

## About BMad Builder

BMad Builder (BMB) is a meta-module for BMad Method that helps you create your own agents and workflows. Whether you're building domain-specific expertise or automating repetitive development tasks, BMB guides you through:

- **Agent Builder** — Create specialized AI agents with custom expertise, communication styles, and tool access
- **Workflow Builder** — Design structured workflows with steps, menus, and cross-workflow communication
- **Module Builder** — Package agents and workflows into shareable BMad modules

## Installation

BMad Builder is installed as a module during BMad Method setup:

```bash
npx bmad-method@alpha install
```

Select **BMad Builder** from the modules list.

## Quick Start

After installing BMad Method with BMB, run from your project root:

```
/bmb-agent
```

This launches the Agent Builder workflow that guides you through creating a custom agent.

## What You Can Build

| Type | Description | Workflow |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Agents** | Domain experts with specialized knowledge and tools | `/bmb-agent` |
| **Workflows** | Structured processes with steps and decision points | `/bmb-workflow` |
| **Modules** | Packaged agents + workflows ready to share | `/bmb-module` |

## Example: Creating a Domain Expert Agent

```
You: /bmb-agent
BMB: What domain should this agent specialize in?
You: Blockchain Development
BMB: Great! A blockchain expert would need to know about...
    [Guides you through agent configuration]
```

## Module Structure

BMad modules follow a standard structure:

```
your-module/
├── src/
│   ├── module.yaml      # Module metadata and install config
│   ├── agents/          # Agent definitions (.agent.yaml)
│   ├── workflows/       # Workflow files
│   └── tools/           # Small reusable tools
└── package.json         # NPM package info
```

## Publishing Your Module

When your module is ready to share:

```bash
# Bump version and create git tag
npm run release

# Or manually:
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
